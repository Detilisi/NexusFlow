    <h2 class="h3 text-primary mb-3">Technology Stack</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Nexus Flow is built using a modern, robust stack that ensures reliability, scalability, and performance:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> Microsoft SQL Server is used as the database solution, providing a secure and efficient way to store and manage account and transaction data. The relational database structure ensures data integrity and allows for complex queries and reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>API:</strong> The backend API is built with ASP.NET Core, providing a RESTful architecture for easy integration and efficient communication between the client (web app) and the server. This ensures that data retrieval and submission are fast and secure.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Application:</strong> The front-end is built using ASP.NET MVC, a powerful web framework that allows for rapid development of dynamic, data-driven websites. The MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller) helps keep the codebase organized and scalable, with clear separation of concerns.</li>
    </ul>
